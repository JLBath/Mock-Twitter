# Mock-Twitter
An app that mocks the basic functionalities of Twitter

This app is mostly the basics of twitter: text posts you can scroll through. The posts are public to any users, there are no "followers."

In this app, you must be a user to access the content. Once you are registered as a user and logged in, you can see the posts 
that are public for any user to see and post on. Posts update in real time.

A user can make a text post that is stored in a public list of posts. 
You can navigate through the pages of posts by clicking the numbers on the bottom. A user can create a post by clicking the button on the top. 
This project has some issues that have yet to be resolved, for example: a user is not able to delete a post and the trash icon 
is shown on every post, regardless if the user is the owner or not.
